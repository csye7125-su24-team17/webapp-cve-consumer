# Webapp CVE Consumer
This Go application connects to a PostgreSQL database and a Kafka broker. It consumes messages from a Kafka topic, parses them as JSON into a CVE struct, and stores them in the database with versioning support. The application also exposes readiness and liveness endpoints for health checks. The readiness probe verifies database and Kafka connectivity and the existence of a specific Kafka topic, while the liveness probe confirms the application is running. This application is designed to run as a container in a pod with appropriate environment variables.

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables that are retrieved using os.Getenv() and used to establish connections to the database and Kafka broker.

### Setting Environment Variables
Once the Docker image is built, appropriate environment variables like db_host, db_port, db_name, db_user, db_password, kafka_host, kafka_port and kafka_topic need to be supplied to the container to ensure that the pod does not fail.

## Building the Docker Image

1. Build and push Docker Image using buildx:
   
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t DOCKER_USERNAME/cve-consumer:latest --push .
